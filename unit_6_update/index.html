				<p>The Arlington Concert Band (ACB), formerly the Arlington Community Band, is a wind ensemble made up of more than 50 professional music educators and dedicated, talented amateur musicians.  We perform regularly throughout the community and play a variety of music, from marches to show tunes and classical arrangements. The ACB is made up of musicians from a variety of backgrounds &ndash; from lawyers to IT professionals to retirees &ndash;but we’re all united around the ACB’s mission:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>To bring a mix of family friendly, professional music to the community for all to enjoy; and</li>
					<li>To provide an outlet for members of the Arlington community to make playing music a lifelong activity.</li>
				</ul>	

				<p>Membership is open without audition to all musicians; please contact the band for availability.</p>
